# Measurements

Build and load measurements for the router index (plan step 6 / roadmap M6).
Machine: Apple Silicon (Darwin arm64), CPython 3.11.15.

## 2026-09-27: partial UK (Stage A data), index format v1 (JSON tables + gzipped coordinate list)

Input:
- 33,788 instruments (10,720 with structure, 23,068 metadata-only);
- 2,026,078 coordinates;
- 41,668 out-of-coverage catalogue instruments.

| Measure | Value | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Build time (`--no-verify`) | 21.0 s | — |
| Build peak RSS | 960 MB | — |
| Index size on disk | 59.4 MB (coordinates 5.3 MB gz; coverage 15.1; typo 11.2; instruments 9.9; titles 8.3; words 6.3; wordsets 2.1; numbers 1.3) | — |
| **Load time** (`load_index`) | **2,028 ms** | **< 450 ms ✗** |
| **Resident memory after load** | **≈ 990 MB** | ✗ |
| Existence lookup (frozenset) | 80 ns | ✓ |

Per-table load profile (the tracer inflates times about 2×; the proportions hold):

| Table | Load | Retained |
|---|---|---|
| coordinates (frozenset + sorted list + canonical map) | 1,829 ms | 285 MB |
| typo (418k delete variants) | 301 ms | 104 MB |
| coverage | 122 ms | 54 MB |
| instruments | 125 ms | 47 MB |
| titles (100,636 keys) | 59 ms | 31 MB |
| words | 39 ms | 24 MB |
| numbers + wordsets + aliases + case variants | 26 ms | 14 MB |

Reading:
- **frozenset + bisect misses the load budget** at 2M coordinates.
- A node-per-token trie holds one object per segment and would be heavier still.
- Full UK is roughly 2–3× this size (≈ 100k SIs still downloading).
- Plan step 6 anticipated this: past about 1M coordinates, switch to a memory-mapped sorted blob searched with bisect.
- Raw sorted coordinate blob: 54 MB. A Python scan for line offsets takes 158 ms; precomputing the offsets at build time makes that 0 ms.

Decision pending: roadmap Q-M6-1.
